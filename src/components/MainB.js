                    <h2>Im so happy you found me!</h2>
                    <p>Im a webdeveloper newly learnt and eager to keep on learning, which puts you and me in a perfect situation to move forward together!</p>
                    <p>Right now my favorite way to build things is a a lovely mix of TailwindCSS and React, which makes all parts of the work fun and intresting.</p>
                    <p>I am also fluent in CSS and SASS so if you want something built from the ground up i can help you with that also.</p>
                    <p>The use of Javascript on pages aint a problem, its just that React is quicker and more secure by basic to work with.</p>
                    <p>I have done a few projects with others so my skills with Git is decent enough for me to feel comfortable in working with others on projects.</p>
                    <p>Also on my projects ive had an Agile workway which is the way i prefer working, if you have another way please enlighten me im curious to learn about other ways also.</p>
                    <p>I have a strong urge of helping out and keeping my clients and co-workers in a good space during the whole process.</p>
                    <p>If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:birger@iambios.com">birger (at) iamBiOS . com</a></p>
